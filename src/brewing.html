	  <!-- to do -->
	  <p>Brewed coffee is made by pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans, then allowing to brew.
	   There are several methods for doing this, including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press.
	    Terms used for the resulting coffee often reflect the method used, such as drip brewed coffee,
	     filtered coffee, pour-over coffee, immersion brewed coffee, or simply coffee. Water seeps
	      through the ground coffee, absorbing its constituent chemical compounds, and then passes 
	      through a filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter, while the brewed
	       coffee is collected in a vessel such as a carafe or pot. </p>
