	  <p>Espresso</p>
	  <p>Espresso (/ɛˈsprɛsoʊ/, Italian: [eˈsprɛsso]) is a coffee-brewing method of Italian origin,
	   in which a small amount of nearly boiling water (about 90 °C or 190 °F) is forced under 9–10 bars (900–1,000 kPa; 130–150 psi)
	    of pressure (expressed) through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso coffee can be made with a wide variety of coffee beans
	     and roast degrees. Espresso is the most common way of making coffee in southern Europe, especially in Italy,
	      Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Southern France and Bulgaria.
